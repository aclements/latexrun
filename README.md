See LaTeX run.  Run latexrun.

latexrun fits LaTeX into a modern build environment.  It hides LaTeX's
circular dependencies, surfaces errors in a standard and user-friendly
format, and generally enables other tools to do what they do best.


Features
========

* Runs latex the right number of times.  LaTeX's iterative approach is
  a poor match for build tools that expect to run a task once and be
  done with it.  latexrun hides this complexity by running LaTeX (and
  BibTeX) as many times as necessary and no more.  Only the results
  from the final run are shown, making it act like a standard,
  single-run build task.

* Surfaces error messages and warnings.  LaTeX and related tools bury
  errors and useful warnings in vast wastelands of output noise.
  latexrun prints only the messages that matter, in a format
  understood by modern tools.  latexrun even figures out file names
  and line numbers for many BibTeX errors that usually don't indicate
  their source.

        paper.tex:140: Overfull \hbox (15pt too wide)
        paper.tex:400: Reference `sec:eval' on page 5 undefined
        local.bib:230: empty booktitle in clements:commutativity

* Incremental progress reporting.  latexrun keeps you informed of
  LaTeX's progress, without overwhelming you with output.

* Cleaning.  LaTeX's output files are legion.  latexrun keeps track of
  them and can clean them up for you.

* Atomic commit.  latexrun updates output files atomically, which
  means your PDF reader will no longer crash or complain about broken
  xref tables when it catches latex in the middle of writing out a
  PDF.

* Easy {.git,.hg,svn:}ignore.  Just ignore `latex.out/`.  Done!

* Self-contained.  latexrun is a single, self-contained Python script
  that can be copied in to your source tree so your collaborators
  don't have to install it.


Non-features
------------

Kitchen sink not included.  latexrun is not a build system.  It will
not convert your graphics behind your back.  It will not continuously
monitor your files for changes.  It will not start your previewer for
you.  latexrun is designed to be *part* of your build system and let
other tools do what they do well.


Integrating with make
=====================

latexrun does its own dependency tracking (at a finer granularity than
`make`). In order to facilitate integration with `make`, latexrun's
`--query` command will check if there is work to be done and output
a phony target to depend on if there is. Here's a complete example:

```Makefile
PAPER_DEP:=$(shell latexrun --query paper.tex)
.PHONY: $(PAPER_DEP)
paper.pdf: $(PAPER_DEP) {files that need to be generated, if any}
	latexrun paper.tex

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	latexrun --clean-all
```

Note that `paper.pdf` depends on a phony target, but is not itself
phony, since this would cause `make` to consider anything that
*depended* on `paper.pdf` to always be out of date.  Instead, `make`
only considers targets that depend on `paper.pdf` out of date if
latexrun actually updates `paper.pdf`.


Comparison with other tools
===========================

Several other tools achieve the same basic goal as latexrun: to
automatically run LaTeX and BibTeX the right number of times.

Rubber
------

Rubber inspired many features of latexrun.  Rubber showed that it's
possible to abstract away many of LaTeX's eccentricities like
iterative builds and user-hostile logs.  latexrun is a response to
Rubber: it attempts to capture its best features while further
modernizing the LaTeX build process and adhering to the Unix
philosophy of "do one thing well."

latexrun has more user-friendly and modern defaults than Rubber.  It
defaults to reporting important warnings like unknown references,
rather than suppressing all warnings.  It defaults to PDF output,
rather than DVI output.  It defaults to putting all intermediate
output in a directory, rather than inheriting LaTeX's default behavior
of filling your source tree with intermediate files.  It also has
features that interact better with modern tools, like atomic commit
for PDF viewers that use file system notification to automatically
refresh.

latexrun has robust post-execution dependency analysis, while Rubber
works by parsing your TeX code.  TeX is, famously, the only thing that
can correctly parse TeX code and as a result Rubber's dependency
analysis is fragile.  Simple things like
```latex
    \newcommand{\includegraph}[1]{\includegraphics{graph/#1.pdf}}
    \includegraph{results}
```
break Rubber's dependency analysis.

latexrun is simple.  It's intentionally a single, self-contained, and
reasonably short Python script that you can drop in next to your LaTeX
sources so your collaborators don't have to install it.  Rubber is
modular, which is admirable but results in a non-zero setup cost.

latexrun fits in to your toolchain, while Rubber tries to replace it.
Rubber goes beyond building LaTeX code with "features" like automatic
graphics conversion based on a weighted shortest-path walk through
known converters.  This makes its build process unpredictable and
means that other build tools like `make` integrate poorly with it.
latexrun prefers explicit over implicit, and tries to make latex act
like a modern tool in your toolchain to enable other tools to do what
*they* do best.

latexmk
-------

latexmk is a venerable LaTeX wrapper that has amassed an impressive
array of options, flags, and features.  It includes many features that
latexrun leaves to other tools---like starting viewers, printing, and
conversion to PDF from DVI and PostScript---or simply omits---like
adding banners and automatically invoking `make` for missing files.

Like latexrun, latexmk can use the "file recorder" feature of modern
TeX engines to compute precise file dependencies.  However, latexrun
also tracks non-file dependencies like environment variables and knows
how to track filtered file contents (like only the lines that actually
matter to BibTeX).

latexmk simply passes through LaTeX's log spew, while latexrun
extracts errors and warnings and displays them in a friendly, modern
format.


How latexrun works
==================

latexrun views the world as a cyclic graph of deterministic functions
of system state:

         .tex → ┌───────┐ ─────────────────────────→ .pdf
    ╭─── .aux → │       │ → .aux ──╮
    │╭── .toc → │ latex │ → .toc ─╮│
    ││╭─ .bbl → │       │ → .log  ││
    │││     … → └───────┘ → …     ││
    │╰────────────────────────────╯│
    ╰──────────────────────────────┤
      │                            ↓
      │                 .bst → ┌────────┐ → .blg
      │                 .bib → │ bibtex │ → .bbl ─╮
      │                        └────────┘         │
      ╰───────────────────────────────────────────╯

latexrun's goal is to find the *fixed-point* of this computation.  Put
simply, it runs latex and bibtex repeatedly until it can guarantee
that additional runs will not change the output.

A direct approach could be to check the output of latex and bibtex
after each run and stop when the output is the same from one run to
the next.  This works, but runs latex too many times; it will have
already produced its final output one iteration before this approach
can figure out that it's done.

Instead, latexrun models latex and bibtex as deterministic functions
of the file system state, their command-line arguments, and certain
environment variables.  Hence, if the *inputs* to latex and bibtex do
not change over one iteration, then latexrun can guarantee that the
output also will not change, and stop.


Known issues
============

When a missing file is silently ignored by latex (e.g., `\openin`,
`\IfFileExists`), latexrun can't track that the *lack* of that file
was important.  Hence, if a missing file is later created, latexrun
may not re-run latex.  However, missing files that cause latex to
abort (e.g., missing files in `\input`) as well as missing `\include`
files (which do not cause aborts) are handled.

Command-line usage errors when calling latex appear before "This is
pdfTeX" and are not logged and therefore often not reported.


To do
=====

* Solve the problem of missing input files.  LaTeX doesn't record
  inputs that it couldn't read, so we don't know about them even
  though they affect the computation (often seriously!).  Possible
  solutions include ptrace, FUSE, and fanotify, but none of these are
  portable or easily accessible from Python.

* Provide a way to disable output filters for things that do their own
  output parsing (e.g., AUCTeX).

* Separate clean data by source file so you can clean a single input
  file's outputs.

* Some important things like undefined references are only considered
  warnings since they don't stop compilation.  Maybe distinguish
  document-mangling warnings (almost but not quite errors) and format
  warnings (can be ignored if justified).

* Perhaps separate out the LaTeX output filter so it can be used on
  its own as a pipe filter.  It could even be used on high-level
  output, like from make, by acting as a pass-through until the "This
  is (pdf)TeX" line up to the "Transcript written on" line (or
  anything else that can end TeX's log output).
